                                    After gaining a better sense of the different needs of instructors at Western Oregon University after attending different workshops offered by the Center for Academic Innovation, this open source tutorial on utilizing Canvas' Outcome was created to support instructors as they organize their course to further develop their objectives and main outcome. This tool helps support instructors as they begin to set up their course to implement the Outcomes tool to ensure their assessment data and assignments directly align to course objectives, thus showcasing the progress in which students are reaching course outcomes. The tutorial leads instructors towards how to properly set up Outcomes in Canvas and helps to support their independent efforts to craft Outcomes and Objectives that directly relate to the course they're creating and how to embed them into Quizzes, Assignments, and more. The tutorial also points readers towards further documentation as a way to encourage further usage beyond the confines of the tutorial.</p>
