                    Seeing as Educational technology is a rapidly evolving industry, there is so much literature to familarize one's self with to ensure that new tools, platforms, frameworks, and approaches can be actively reflected upon. These literary pieces were tackled to help in the develop of the different innovative pivots I strive to make within the industry. Educational technology is evergrowing and as a professional within the field, these are some works that showcase how I've taken the time to dive into my own professional development.

                Much research has yet to be done to not only resolve issues in artificial intelligence, but also to help the world become more at ease with the capabilities AI has to offer.
               Recent literature has been reviewed to develop concepts discussed in this write up to help expand upon this idea, as well as brainstorm possible solutions to help society as a whole
                move towards supporting AI. </p></p></center>

This list of resources not only gives an introduction to all of these moving pieces that are involved in design, but also provides resources while diving deeper into certain topics that content creators should focus on to reach organizational goals.

                                During my own independent study, I took the time to research and learn from different media sources that could help with the professional development of skills that I needed to hone in on before working with Unity.
                                This tool kit is made up of a list of 5-8 video tutorials of skills that would be useful to learn in order become fully introduced to Unity. In this list, I provided written documentation of how guidelines could be applied in creating a game within the Unity game development engine.
