                    Seeing as Educational technology is a rapidly evolving industry, there is so much literature to familarize one's self with to ensure that new tools, platforms, frameworks, and approaches can be actively reflected upon. These literary pieces were tackled to help in the develop of the different innovative pivots I strive to make within the industry. Educational technology is evergrowing and as a professional within the field, these are some works that showcase how I've taken the time to dive into my own professional development.

            <p>
                This persuasive piece explores the concept of artificial intelligence and how we as a society have yet to scaffold education and progress that lead artificial intelligence towards success. Much research has yet to be done to not only resolve issues in artificial intelligence, but also to help the world become more at ease with the capabilities AI has to offer. Recent literature has been reviewed to develop concepts discussed in this write up to help expand upon this idea, as well as brainstorm possible solutions to help society as a whole move towards supporting AI. This deep dive into artificial intelligence is meant to give insight on the distortion of artificial intelligence and how we as a society are not actively pushing more awareness on what artificial intelligence really is and how it can be utilized as a tool within education.
                Throughout the discussion, there is a primary focus in educating the reader about the downfalls of the curriculum not having an up to date lens on artificial intelligence and how the lack of proper adjustments to consider these innovations may impact our future and how we are able to further develop the technology we have to properly serve us with more strength in the future. The paper is a great resource to give those who’re newly within the field of technology an introduction on the history of these innovative developments, where we are as a society, and how we should move forward. This discussion not only has the potential to jumpstart an educator or an individual within the technology world a starting point to understand the controversial arguments that are occuring within the industry, but also give them a direction towards some of the avenues of artificial intelligence that can be dug into a bit deeper.

                This paper reflects upon several academic articles and resources that focus on the utilization of Unity to make educational based tools or games.

            <p>After closely collaborating with the Center for Academic Innovation to created an authentic learning experience in a sychronous and asynchronous onboarding training, this instructional design artifact was created in collaboration with members of the Center for Academic Innovation to help train future graduate assistants, as well as provide resources to help current graduate assistants complete their daily responsibilities within the organization. The artifact itself is a Canvas course packed with guidelines, assessments, and media that can be used to help graduate assistants navigate through their day to day tasks during work hours. Finally, this artifact helps to support graduate assistants receiving the certification and workshops that are required of them during their time as graduate assistants and also keeps them on track with deadlines to meet as they fill their hourly requirements and apply for renewal on a term by term basis. </p>

                After closely collaborating with past colleagues in the education realm to created an authentic learning experience in an asynchronous training, this instructional design artifact was created with a strong focus on the need for inclusivity in the classroom. In this self-paced course designed for K-5 general education teachers, participants will gain the knowledge and skills to create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment. Through reflective exercises, they will assess their classroom climate, identify areas for improvement, and implement strategies to foster inclusivity. With accessible resources, videos, and interactive tools, teachers will learn to acknowledge and respect diverse identities, employ inclusive language, and empower their students to find security, comfort, and voice in the educational space.
