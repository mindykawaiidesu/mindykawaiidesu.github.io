                                    Utilizing instructional design frameworks such as ADDIE as a workflow base to apply other pedagogical approaches and intertwine knowledge gained within CSE 626,  such as Gestalt Theory and other basic principles of design, this flyer was created. The goal of this particular artifact was to target audience members within the Nintendo community that play Animal Crossing: New Horizons and inform them of the latest upcoming in-game event. After analyzing the different ways in which Nintendo had announced the event to the gamer community, this flyer was designed and developed to further inform the gamer community. Design decisions made for the poster focused on the reduction of cognitive overload while also being detailed and informative, as well as engaging.

                                    This artifact was created during CSE 624 as a way to give readers an introduction to key concepts within the licensing world. By applying the basic principles of design and the principles of andragogy and effective teaching methods, this resource for designers was created. The resource highlights the importance of copyrighting, creative commons, fair use, and public domain and gives different real life scenarios where these ideas have relevance and tangible connections to the eyes of readers. These scenarios base in reality helps to encourage readers to form connections that directly apply to their own background and experiences.

                                <p>
                                    This persuasive piece explores the concept of artificial intelligence and how we as a society have yet to scaffold education and progress that lead artificial intelligence towards success. Much research has yet to be done to not only resolve issues in artificial intelligence, but also to help the world become more at ease with the capabilities AI has to offer. Recent literature has been reviewed to develop concepts discussed in this write up to help expand upon this idea, as well as brainstorm possible solutions to help society as a whole move towards supporting AI. This deep dive into artificial intelligence is meant to give insight on the distortion of artificial intelligence and how we as a society are not actively pushing more awareness on what artificial intelligence really is and how it can be utilized as a tool within education.
                                    Throughout the discussion, there is a primary focus in educating the reader about the downfalls of the curriculum not having an up to date lens on artificial intelligence and how the lack of proper adjustments to consider these innovations may impact our future and how we are able to further develop the technology we have to properly serve us with more strength in the future. The paper is a great resource to give those who’re newly within the field of technology an introduction on the history of these innovative developments, where we are as a society, and how we should move forward. This discussion not only has the potential to jumpstart an educator or an individual within the technology world a starting point to understand the controversial arguments that are occuring within the industry, but also give them a direction towards some of the avenues of artificial intelligence that can be dug into a bit deeper.

                                <p>After closely collaborating with the Center for Academic Innovation and reviewing goals of the different workshops already established, as well as investigating the potential needs for professional development for educators, TILT came to fruition to emphasizes empowerment in the learning experiences within the Canvas learning space. TILT focuses on the importance of developing transparent outcomes and objectivest that are presented with immense intentionality in virtual classroom spaces and aims to shape the perspective of educators to showcase the importance of developing TILT. The Transparency in Teaching & Learning transparency framework provides a mechanism for laying out the Purpose, Task, and Criteria for Success when designing assignments and assessments. This transparent, explicit approach helps deconstruct “unwritten” rules for academic achievement to set all learners up for success. This artifact was created and presented to guide professors explore how greater transparency can increase your students’ consciousness of how they learn and how your course activities support specific learning outcomes and academic growth. </p>

                                    This media source list models Unity as a technological resource that has the ability to create gamified learning artifacts and projects. During my own independent study, I explored and evaluated different media sources that help with the development of skills to later curate a game with the engine. Through this independent study, I took the time to research and learn from different media sources that could help with the professional development of skills that I needed to hone in on before working with Unity.
                                    This tool kit is made up of a list of 5-8 video tutorials of skills that would be useful to learn in order become fully introduced to Unity. In this list, I provided written documentation of how guidelines could be applied in creating a game within the Unity game development engine.

                                <p>As instructional designers, editing and effects strategies such as masking allow for us to create interactive and engaging videos. This artifact was created as a model for fellow instructional designers on how to adapt Adobe Premiere as a new digital resource for learning. After exploring this resource and identifying and evaluating the key features that are crucial to master as a beginner, I created this tutorial. After watching this video, viewers will be able to utilize the masking effect technique in Adobe Premiere to implement in their own content. </p>

                                    This artifact was created for the Center for Academic Innovation as a way to keep track of the different clerical events that occur throughout a term and keep the department organized for creating course shells and more. After closely collaborating with CAI members to better understand the workflow and coding logic to create a script that would automatically generate a Google Calendar with these important date labels, Chat GPT was explored as a resource to create the automation. The automation itself takes in data from user input that is retreived from a Google Sheet that then takes the input and automatically generates a calendar with labeled weeks and important clerical benchmarks. After creating this successful prototype, the artifact was showcased to team members of the CAI to give comments and feedback and lead to their inspiration to trial ChatGPT to further improve this automation process. CAI members were able to gather the benefits of utilizing Chat GPT and utilize the AI tool for their own personal projects.

                                <p> This virtual and interative way of peering at a cookbook helps to engage stuidents in a more learner-driven and self paced way that accommodates for learning variability through thoughful design that prevents cognitive overload, but promotes active learning. This artifact was created during CSE 508 as a way to create a gamified way for users to experience a virtual  cookbook. Storyline Articulate was utilized to program interactive buttons that guide readers through the cookbook with a variety of hand drawn or created images that keep true to the pixel art digital theme of the game itself.  </p>

                                <p>After closely collaborating with the Center for Academic Innovation to created an authentic learning experience in a sychronous and asynchronous onboarding training, this instructional design artifact was created in collaboration with members of the Center for Academic Innovation to help train future graduate assistants, as well as provide resources to help current graduate assistants complete their daily responsibilities within the organization. The artifact itself is a Canvas course packed with guidelines, assessments, and media that can be used to help graduate assistants navigate through their day to day tasks during work hours. Finally, this artifact helps to support graduate assistants receiving the certification and workshops that are required of them during their time as graduate assistants and also keeps them on track with deadlines to meet as they fill their hourly requirements and apply for renewal on a term by term basis. </p>

                                    After reviewing feedback and data from the needs of this nonprofit in regards to their onboarding needs, this site was created to help further support instruction and student learning for new members of the nonprofit through an onboarding process through this virtual training. This artifact was created during CSE 680 to essentially take retired artifacts and merge them into one all encompassing docket. During the creation of this artifact, redesign methods based on Gestalt Principles were utilized to create an all encompassing design for the organization that merges together the different onboarding dockets of multiple departments and open positions into one engaging space. Seeing as the organization had a challenging time structuring their brand in a way that allows for viewers to understand and fully absorb the knowledge presented in the prior pieces, several retired artifacts were taken to create a new space for learners to gain knowledge at their own pace and utilize the resource for their own purposes.

                                    After gaining a better sense of the different needs of instructors at Western Oregon University after attending different workshops offered by the Center for Academic Innovation, this open source tutorial on utilizing Canvas' Outcome was created to support instructors as they organize their course to further develop their objectives and main outcome. This tool helps support instructors as they begin to set up their course to implement the Outcomes tool to ensure their assessment data and assignments directly align to course objectives, thus showcasing the progress in which students are reaching course outcomes. The tutorial leads instructors towards how to properly set up Outcomes in Canvas and helps to support their independent efforts to craft Outcomes and Objectives that directly relate to the course they're creating and how to embed them into Quizzes, Assignments, and more. The tutorial also points readers towards further documentation as a way to encourage further usage beyond the confines of the tutorial.
