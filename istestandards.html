TILT focuses on the importance of developing transparent outcomes and objectivest that are presented with immense intentionality in virtual classroom spaces and aims to shape the perspective of educators to showcase the importance of developing TILT. The Transparency in Teaching & Learning transparency framework provides a mechanism for laying out the Purpose, Task, and Criteria for Success when designing assignments and assessments. This transparent, explicit approach helps deconstruct “unwritten” rules for academic achievement to set all learners up for success. This artifact was created and presented to guide professors explore how greater transparency can increase your students’ consciousness of how they learn and how your course activities support specific learning outcomes and academic growth. </p>

The artifact itself is a Canvas course packed with guidelines, assessments, and media that can be used to help graduate assistants navigate through their day to day tasks during work hours. Finally, this artifact helps to support graduate assistants receiving the certification and workshops that are required of them during their time as graduate assistants and also keeps them on track with deadlines to meet as they fill their hourly requirements and apply for renewal on a term by term basis. </p>

                                    Utilizing skills in coding within a game engine to create a tool that fosters independent learning in both a supplementary and interventional lens, this artifact was created during an independent study course based on Unity Real-Time Development Platform. This resource was created to support classroom teachers, parents, and tutors in finding interactive ways for students to practice building their phonics skills. This interactive game allows for users to virtually simulate encoding and decoding CVC words with interactive buttons, signaling colors to indicate vowels and consonants and features that mimic Phontas and Pinnell practices.

This artifact was created during CSE 680 to essentially take retired artifacts and merge them into one all encompassing docket. During the creation of this artifact, redesign methods based on Gestalt Principles were utilized to create an all encompassing design for the organization that merges together the different onboarding dockets of multiple departments and open positions into one engaging space. Seeing as the organization had a challenging time structuring their brand in a way that allows for viewers to understand and fully absorb the knowledge presented in the prior pieces, several retired artifacts were taken to create a new space for learners to gain knowledge at their own pace and utilize the resource for their own purposes.
