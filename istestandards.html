                                    This persuasive piece explores the concept of artificial intelligence and how we as a society have yet to scaffold education and progress that lead artificial intelligence towards success. Much research has yet to be done to not only resolve issues in artificial intelligence, but also to help the world become more at ease with the capabilities AI has to offer. Recent literature has been reviewed to develop concepts discussed in this write up to help expand upon this idea, as well as brainstorm possible solutions to help society as a whole move towards supporting AI. This deep dive into artificial intelligence is meant to give insight on the distortion of artificial intelligence and how we as a society are not actively pushing more awareness on what artificial intelligence really is and how it can be utilized as a tool within education.
                                    Throughout the discussion, there is a primary focus in educating the reader about the downfalls of the curriculum not having an up to date lens on artificial intelligence and how the lack of proper adjustments to consider these innovations may impact our future and how we are able to further develop the technology we have to properly serve us with more strength in the future. The paper is a great resource to give those who’re newly within the field of technology an introduction on the history of these innovative developments, where we are as a society, and how we should move forward. This discussion not only has the potential to jumpstart an educator or an individual within the technology world a starting point to understand the controversial arguments that are occuring within the industry, but also give them a direction towards some of the avenues of artificial intelligence that can be dug into a bit deeper.

TILT focuses on the importance of developing transparent outcomes and objectivest that are presented with immense intentionality in virtual classroom spaces and aims to shape the perspective of educators to showcase the importance of developing TILT. The Transparency in Teaching & Learning transparency framework provides a mechanism for laying out the Purpose, Task, and Criteria for Success when designing assignments and assessments. This transparent, explicit approach helps deconstruct “unwritten” rules for academic achievement to set all learners up for success. This artifact was created and presented to guide professors explore how greater transparency can increase your students’ consciousness of how they learn and how your course activities support specific learning outcomes and academic growth. </p>

During my own independent study, I explored and evaluated different media sources that help with the development of skills to later curate a game with the engine. Through this independent study, I took the time to research and learn from different media sources that could help with the professional development of skills that I needed to hone in on before working with Unity.

In this list, I provided written documentation of how guidelines could be applied in creating a game within the Unity game development engine.

                                                    Utilizing skills in coding within a game engine to create a tool that fosters independent learning in both a supplementary and interventional lens, this artifact was created during an independent study course based on Unity Real-Time Development Platform. This resource was created to support classroom teachers, parents, and tutors in finding interactive ways for students to practice building their phonics skills. This interactive game allows for users to virtually simulate encoding and decoding CVC words with interactive buttons, signaling colors to indicate vowels and consonants and features that mimic Phontas and Pinnell practices.

This artifact was created during CSE 508 as a way to create a gamified way for users to experience a virtual  cookbook. Storyline Articulate was utilized to program interactive buttons that guide readers through the cookbook with a variety of hand drawn or created images that keep true to the pixel art digital theme of the game itself.  </p>

This artifact was created during CSE 680 to essentially take retired artifacts and merge them into one all encompassing docket. During the creation of this artifact, redesign methods based on Gestalt Principles were utilized to create an all encompassing design for the organization that merges together the different onboarding dockets of multiple departments and open positions into one engaging space. Seeing as the organization had a challenging time structuring their brand in a way that allows for viewers to understand and fully absorb the knowledge presented in the prior pieces, several retired artifacts were taken to create a new space for learners to gain knowledge at their own pace and utilize the resource for their own purposes.
