Her name is Juniper and she loves being the taste tester for all the yummy treats!We live here in Bend but I'm originally from Central Massachusetts.I first found Bend when I was thru-hiking the Pacific Crest Trail in 2020. I had come into town while I was on trail to recover from an injury and fell in love with it.I love the outdoors. Everything from trail running, mountain biking, backpacking, snowboarding and day hikes. Bend is my playground!I love all animals, baking, being creative, house plants, supporting small businesses and the community, being with my family and friends, live music and exploring new places.~I'm very honored to be a queer woman owned small business in this supportive town. Excited for the future of my little bakery!

                                – I have been in Bend for over 10 years now, and am excited to see the amount of queer people/business openly represented in our community. I hope to see that continue! I am a financial advisor with Northwestern Mutual, and my husband has a small construction business. We enjoy paddle boarding with our two pups and going to concerts!

                                In my own personal experience, the financial planning and investment world has not been particularly welcoming to the queer community. I was thoroughly intimidated sitting in the fancy office on the top floor of the commercial building. Oftentimes, I was overlooked due to my presentation. I don't wish this experience on anyone.

                                It is my mission to change that by creating a safe space for individuals, families, domestic/life partners, self-employed makers, and business owners to seek financial guidance through education and support. Finances can be a very personal, intimate thing to talk about. I am happy to meet anyone exactly where they are.

                                I would love to hear your story, and how I might be able to help. Happy to connect over coffee/tea in an informal manner - we are in Bend, after all!

                                – I have been in Bend for over 10 years now, and am excited to see the amount of queer people/business openly represented in our community. I hope to see that continue! I am a financial advisor with Northwestern Mutual, and my husband has a small construction business. We enjoy paddle boarding with our two pups and going to concerts!

                                In my own personal experience, the financial planning and investment world has not been particularly welcoming to the queer community. I was thoroughly intimidated sitting in the fancy office on the top floor of the commercial building. Oftentimes, I was overlooked due to my presentation. I don't wish this experience on anyone.

                                It is my mission to change that by creating a safe space for individuals, families, domestic/life partners, self-employed makers, and business owners to seek financial guidance through education and support. Finances can be a very personal, intimate thing to talk about. I am happy to meet anyone exactly where they are.

                                I would love to hear your story, and how I might be able to help. Happy to connect over coffee/tea in an informal manner - we are in Bend, after all!
